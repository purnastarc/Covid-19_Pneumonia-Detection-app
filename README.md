Covid - 19 Pneumonia Detection App -  The created model will be able to detect pneumonia based on Chest X-Ray images :

Created a convolutional neural network model using Keras provided by the TensorFlow library.
The data set used for training the model contains a mixture of “COVID-19” and “Normal” chest x-ray scan images.
Data augmentation was performed on the dataset by creating multiple variations of the same image to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
The model achieved an accuracy of 95%.
The model was provided to the end-users as a web application by integrating it into the Flask web framework.
